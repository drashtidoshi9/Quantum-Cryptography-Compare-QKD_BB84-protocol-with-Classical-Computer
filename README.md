Quantum cryptography is one of the emerging topics in the field of computer industry. Quantum Cryptography is the future of the next generation.The best known example of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution 

<h1>Methodology</h1>

Alice <br>
        Encodes her information randomly in one of the two bases…
   

For example,<br>
     Basis A  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Basis B <br>
     | 0> = 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | 0> = 0 <br>
     | 0> = 0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  | 0> = 0<br>

Alice’s bits &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0101100010101100 <br>
Alice’s bases &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;BAABAABAAAABBBBA <br>
States sent  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +10-10+0101+--+0 <br>

Bob receives the stream of qubits and measures each one in a random basis: ABAABAAABABBBBA <br>
